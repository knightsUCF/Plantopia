# Plantopia



# To Do 

- create terrain like in the island tutorial and Train Valley 2

- create a satisfying planting mechanism:

  - tap on device to plant with a plopping sound (can pop lips)
  
  - begin timer to grow
  
  - "pop" out plant (game juice / sugar) when done growing
  
  - harvest plant by tapping for money (each individually)
  
- allow to buy land parcel box

- allow to buy seeds

- show tokens on screen






# May 1

- okay, so some of the basics are established

- not sure whether this will be a mobile or steam early access game yet

- we have the workers going, raycasts to guide them, token count, menu for choosing planting, a data and a settings file, so the basics are here

- we would like to do something similar to Rimworld, where we can to the nerdy nitty gritty aspect of a simulation

- so as we plant more fields we will need to hire more workers, workers subtract costs out of our tokens on a cyclical basis

- need a separate menu for generating workers like in RTS games, check out their menus how to group

- don't be overly concerned about the menu layout since that will change menu times

- when a workers is doing an action like tilling the earth, before we can get animations going, we can simply display an overhead icon of what the worker is doing, so a shovel for tilling the earth for example

- modeling the island in blender will help with visuals

- a nice menu will also help with the game appearance

- island + nice menu = presentable game

- at first we will just be planting box gardens

- tractor and then solar for power and the water tanks like in RimWorld

- so at first we want a few box gardens with different seeds 

- and we want to set up the growing mechanism

- RESEARCH: watch videos of people on farms / industrial farms to check what we can model in 3D, and what sort of mechanisms we can implement

- we will eventually automate the farm, so stuff like watering, solar power energy, we will have auto yields like in Factorio

- so what is next on the todo:


  - model the island (blender tutorial)
  - model workers (sebastian lague tutorial)
  - choose a sexy menu (maybe Train Valley 2 for now)
  - this will begin to look like a game
  - maybe even have a score
  - add sound effects
  - create growth mechanism for plants
  - create mechanism to set down new box gardens
  - create graphic for when the earth is first tilled
  - create action mechanism for workers to go near tilling earth spots and show tilling earth icon until the animation is ready
  - create different plants that will grow after the time cycle, although vary their height so they don't look so mechanical
  - allow to sell harvest for more money
  - more money can pay for increased workers, getting rid of the labor bottleneck for advancing gameplay
  - offer upgrades like solar power, automatic watering, tractor, etc
