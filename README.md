# Plantopia



# To Do 

- create terrain like in the island tutorial and Train Valley 2

- create a satisfying planting mechanism:

  - tap on device to plant with a plopping sound (can pop lips)
  
  - begin timer to grow
  
  - "pop" out plant (game juice / sugar) when done growing
  
  - harvest plant by tapping for money (each individually)
  
- allow to buy land parcel box

- allow to buy seeds

- show tokens on screen






# May 1

- okay, so some of the basics are established

- not sure whether this will be a mobile or steam early access game yet

- we have the workers going, raycasts to guide them, token count, menu for choosing planting, a data and a settings file, so the basics are here

- we would like to do something similar to Rimworld, where we can to the nerdy nitty gritty aspect of a simulation

- so as we plant more fields we will need to hire more workers, workers subtract costs out of our tokens on a cyclical basis

- need a separate menu for generating workers like in RTS games, check out their menus how to group

- don't be overly concerned about the menu layout since that will change menu times

- when a workers is doing an action like tilling the earth, before we can get animations going, we can simply display an overhead icon of what the worker is doing, so a shovel for tilling the earth for example

- modeling the island in blender will help with visuals

- a nice menu will also help with the game appearance

- island + nice menu = presentable game

- at first we will just be planting box gardens

- tractor and then solar for power and the water tanks like in RimWorld

- so at first we want a few box gardens with different seeds 

- and we want to set up the growing mechanism
